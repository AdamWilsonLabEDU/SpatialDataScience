# Data wrangling

## Useful packages: [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/)

[Cheat sheets on website](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) for [Data Wrangling](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)

```{r,results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
```
Remember use `install.packages("tidyverse")` to install a new package.

###  Example operations from [here](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html)

## New York City Flights
Data from [US Bureau of Transportation Statistics](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DatabaseInfo.asp?DB_ID=120&Link=0) (see `?nycflights13`)
```{r,results='hide', warning=F}
library(nycflights13)
```
Check out the `flights` object
```{r}
head(flights)
```

### Object _Structure_
Check out data _structure_ with `glimpse()`
```{r}
glimpse(flights)
```

# `dplyr` "verbs"

* `select()` and `rename()`: Extract existing variables
* `filter()` and `slice()`: Extract existing observations
* `arrange()`
* `distinct()`
* `mutate()` and `transmute()`: Derive new variables
* `summarise()`: Change the unit of analysis
* `sample_n()` and `sample_frac()`

## Useful select functions

* "`-`"  Select everything but
* "`:`"  Select range
* `contains()` Select columns whose name contains a character string
* `ends_with()` Select columns whose name ends with a string
* `everything()` Select every column
* `matches()` Select columns whose name matches a regular expression
* `num_range()` Select columns named x1, x2, x3, x4, x5
* `one_of()` Select columns whose names are in a group of names
* `starts_with()` Select columns whose name starts with a character string

### `select()` examples
Select only the `year`, `month`, and `day` columns:
```{r}
select(flights,year, month, day)
```

### `select()` examples

Select everything _except_ the `tailnum`:
```{r}
select(flights,-tailnum)
```

Select all columns containing the string `"time"`:
```{r}
select(flights,contains("time"))
```

You can also rename columns with `select()`
```{r}
select(flights,year,carrier,destination=dest)
```

## `filter()` observations

Filter all flights that departed on on January 1st:

```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```


## _Base_ R method
This is equivalent to the more verbose code in base R:

```{r}
flights[flights$month == 1 & flights$day == 1, ]
```

Compare with `dplyr` method: 
```{r,eval=F}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```


<div class="well">
Filter the `flights` data set to keep only evening flights (`dep_time` after 1600) in June.

<button data-toggle="collapse" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm round" data-target="#demo1">Show Solution</button>
<div id="demo1" class="collapse">

```{r, purl=F}
filter(flights,dep_time>1600,month==6)
```
</div>
</div>



## Other _boolean_ expressions
`filter()` is similar to `subset()` except it handles any number of filtering conditions joined together with `&`. 

You can also use other boolean operators, such as _OR_ ("|"):
```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1 | month == 2)
```

<div class="well">
Filter the `flights` data set to keep only flights where the `distance` is greater than 1000 OR the `air_time` is more than 100

<button data-toggle="collapse" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm round" data-target="#demo2">Show Solution</button>
<div id="demo2" class="collapse"> <br>

```{r, purl=FALSE}
filter(flights,distance>1000|air_time>100)
```
</div>
</div>



## Select rows with `slice()`:
```{r}
slice(flights, 1:10)
```

## `arrange()` rows

`arrange()` is similar to `filter()` except it reorders instead of filtering.  

```{r}
arrange(flights, year, month, day)
```

_Base_ R method:
```{r,eval=F}
flights[order(flights$year, flights$month, flights$day), ]
```


## Descending order: `desc()`

```{r}
arrange(flights, desc(arr_delay))
```

_Base_ R method:
```{r,eval=F}
flights[order(desc(flights$arr_delay)), ]
```



## Distinct: Find distinct rows

```{r}
distinct(
  select(flights,carrier)
)
```



## Mutate: Derive new variables

Adds columns with calculations based on other columns.


Average air speed (miles/hour):
```{r}
mutate(flights,ave_speed=distance/(air_time/60))%>%
  select(distance, air_time,ave_speed)
```



## Chaining Operations
Learn to performing multiple operations sequentially with a _pipe_ character (`%>%`)

1. Group by a variable
2. Select some columns
3. Summarize observations
4. Filter by results


With temporary objects:
```{r}
a1 <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)
a2 <- select(a1, arr_delay, dep_delay)
a3 <- summarise(a2,
                arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
                dep = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
a4 <- filter(a3, arr > 30 | dep > 30)
head(a4)
```

If you don’t want to save the intermediate results: wrap the function calls inside each other:

```{r}
filter(
  summarise(
    select(
      group_by(flights, year, month, day),
      arr_delay, dep_delay
    ),
    arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    dep = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ),
  arr > 30 | dep > 30
)
```

Arguments are distant from function -> difficult to read!  


## Chaining Operations

`%>%` (from the dplyr package) allows you to _pipe_ together various commands.  

`x %>% f(y)` turns into `f(x, y)`


So you can use it to rewrite multiple operations that you can read left-to-right, top-to-bottom:
```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  select(arr_delay, dep_delay) %>%
  summarise(
    arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    dep = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter(arr > 30 | dep > 30)
```


## Analyze by group with `group_by()`
Perform operations by _group_: mean departure delay by airport (`origin`)

```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(origin) %>%
  summarise(meanDelay = mean(dep_delay,na.rm=T))
```

Perform operations by _group_: mean and sd departure delay by airline (`carrier`)

```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(carrier) %>%  
  summarise(meanDelay = mean(dep_delay,na.rm=T),
            sdDelay =   sd(dep_delay,na.rm=T))
```



<div class="well">
Flights from which `origin` airport go the farthest (on average)?   Hint: Group by airport (`origin`) then calculate the maximum flight distance (`distance`).

<button data-toggle="collapse" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm round" data-target="#demo2a">Show Solution</button>
<div id="demo2a" class="collapse">

```{r,purl=F}
flights %>% 
  group_by(origin) %>%  
  summarise(meanDist = mean(distance,na.rm=T))%>%
  arrange(desc(meanDist))%>%
  slice(1)%>%
  select(origin)
```

</div>
