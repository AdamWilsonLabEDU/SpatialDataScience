## Learning more

For even more in-depth documentation see:

* [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz) book for R users who want to improve their programming skills and understanding of the language. It should also be useful for programmers coming to R from other languages, as it explains some of R’s quirks and shows how some parts that seem horrible do have a positive side.
* The website for the [knitr package](http://yihui.name/knitr/). Knitr is an extremely powerful tool for dynamic content generation and the website has a wealth of documentation and examples to help you utilize it to its full potential.
