```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Reading

```{r reading,results='asis',echo=F}
md_bullet(rmarkdown::metadata$reading)
```

## Introduction to Git

See the presentation associated with this task [here](presentations/Week03_Git.html).

## Course Folder Structure

For the rest of the course, you should keep your files organzed in a git-managed repository.  After syncing your local computer with your class repository, you will have a folder structure similar to the image below.


```{r, out.width="400px", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/folderstructure.png")
```
